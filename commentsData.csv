Did you get a statement of benefits from your insurance?

Did you notice what your doctor charged your insurance?

I had a colonoscopy done a few months ago. The doctors office charged over 10k to the insurance. 

Obviously the insurance company didn't pay it all, only about 70% of what they asked for. 

Now I'm not a genius, but it's clear to see that the high cost of healthcare is because of the doctors and pharmaceutical companies. 

Don't you agree?
Now saying that how can any of you actually expect your insurance premiums and deductibles to become less under Obamacare, Trumpcare or any other care when we haven't even fixed the real problem?

I lived in Europe many years, and in many if not most countries there are limits or tariffs in place that can not be exceeded. 

Doctors can't just charge you these outrageous fees. 
In Germany they tried for a few years to charge a 10€ deductible or copay due once each quarter if you visited the doctor, Germans went bananas. 

That didn't last very long! Now they have neither copay or deductible, and the premiums are in most cases much lower than ours. 

You never wonder how is that possible?

We must accept that we will never have 100 % of our citizens covered by health insurance as many people don't want it, even if  threatened  with steep fines, as resistance to Obamacare has proven.  If it is okay for a 26 year old person to remain on their parents insurance , why not a 30 year old, a 40 year old.....?

"10212083365067795","Brian Fagen","Sad day for public education in the United States. Please research and understand all that is involved with this bill. 

The U.S. House of Representatives has introduced Bill 610. This bill will effectively start the school voucher system to be used by children ages 5 to 17, and starts the de-funding process of public schools.

The bill will eliminate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA) of 1965 which is the nation's educational law and provides equal opportunity in education. It is a comprehensive program that covers programs for struggling learners, AP classes, ESL classes, classes for minorities such as Native Americans, Rural Education, Education for the Homeless, School Safety (Gun-Free schools), Monitoring and Compliance and Federal Accountability Programs.

The bill also abolishes the Nutritional Act of 2012 (No Hungry Kids Act) which provides nutritional standards in school breakfast and lunch. For our most vulnerable, this may be the ONLY nutritious food they have in a day.
The bill has no wording whatsoever protecting special needs kids, no mention of IDEA and FAPE.

Some things the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA) of 1965 does for Children with Disabilities:

-ensures access to the general education curriculum

-ensures access to accommodations on assessments

-ensures concepts of Universal Design for Learning

-includes provisions that require local education agencies to provide evidence-based interventions in schools with consistently underperforming subgroups

-requires states in Title I plans to address how they will improve conditions for learning including reducing incidents of bullying and harassment in schools, overuse of discipline practices and reduce the use of aversive behavioral interventions (such as restraints and seclusion).

Please call your representative and ask him/her to vote NO on House Bill 610 (HR 610) introduced by three Republican reps.

I'm very worried about what I'm hearing about the replacement for Obamacare. I've been waiting for it to be replaced, so I can buy reasonably priced insurance. But now I'm hearing that  there will still be a mandate. I've had to pay a fine to the federal government to not have insurance the past few years. That was very frustrating and totally unfair. But it was cheaper than the outrageously priced insurance plans. And now I'm hearing if I choose not to be insured, that I will have to pay a fine to the insurance carriers. I would like to have reasonable insurance that I can afford, but not have it forced on me. 
I am deeply dissatisfied with the thought that a watered down version of Obamacare is to be forced upon us. 
That is just one of the healthcare replacement items that I'm hearing about and feeling dissatisfied. Please stick to your promise and make sure our health care plan becomes what you promised. Please listen to some of the options that Rand Paul is suggesting. Please do not make this another entitlement program for the hard working middle class to support Again!!  We already pay for the Medicaid program. Which is a very abused program. It should not be a lifetime program!!

I have a progressive disease and have not been financially able to get treatment. I have already had 3 surgeries on my neck and spine. I refuse to take opiates. The spinal fusion in my neck was caused by an unlicensed uninsured kid that stole his mother's car and struck the vehicle I was a passenger in. The ER would not treat me until I filed a claim with my auto insurance even though I had health insurance. Long story short, I am still injured. The auto insurance is refusing to pay and my Health insurance did pay but wants to take my settlement for reimbursement. Again I was injured as a passenger in a vehicle. I still have herniated discs that have been untreated. They have put me between a rock and a hard place. I now have changed health insurances three times since because my employer keeps changing it for cheaper policies. They don't have to pay because it's still in litigation waiting for arbitration. This is going on 5 yrs now. There are no moral values anymore. They do not care whether you live or die just how they will get paid. I say scrap the ACA altogether. Healthcare wasn't broken in the first place. Most states offered charity care that is no longer. Medicaid was offered for the poor in most states as well. Bring healthcare back to what is was. A free market. Cut the wasteful spending and repatriate the funds to the States to assist on medicaid for the poor. If the Federal  Government needs to be involved at all it should be regulating the Healthcare providers. Doctors, Hospitals, and clinics. Right now they are gouging people by what type of insurance you have. You go for blood work and you have no idea what the out of pocket costs are going to be until they bill you.

Read through the plan and if you are currently covered under the ACA, convince yourself how you will be better off when this plan is enacted. Unfortunately, since you have no idea what the insurance premium will be or what level of coverage you will be able to afford, it will be impossible for you to calculate.

The stories about what it was like being attacked from a first hand source were surreal. When he told me stories from D-Day, the only thing I could do was to remind myself to breathe. What his eyes saw and his ears heard tower car above anything I have ever experienced. The thing that happened that was unexpected was how his life is to remembered from the VA. The VA has been good to me, but his daughter is only getting a copied certificate of appreciation signed by the president. The you get when you retire. And he's getting a pre-folded American Flag. That's it. Nothing more to honor his life. A life of a man who fought in two wars, fought at some of the most pivotal operations of the wars, and when it was all said and done; he refused to complain about what the VA did or did not do for because of his service. He instead baked cookies every Sunday with his wife and pass them out to injured veterans and service members at the VA. The only thing he qualifies for upon his death is a certificate and a boxed flag. Are you kidding me? No burial spot, no headstone of any kind, and no proper funeral for one of the last remaining WWII survivors. I don't know what to say, except that I am saddened and disappointed to the core. I don't know much about this stuff at all, but I'm guessing some of you might. If you have dealt with this or had someone pass away who was a veteran, is this really all they do? Is this normal? If it's not, could the DAV or VFW be able to help lay him to rest properly?

So everything you’ll hear from Republicans is a ruse. The real result of the Republican bill:

1. Millions of lower-income people will lose their coverage because the refundable tax credits won’t go far enough.

2. People with pre-existing conditions won’t be covered because insurance companies will demand extraordinarily high premiums, co-payments, and deductibles. 

3. Medicaid will no longer be available for millions, because it’s turned into a block grant to states that’s phased out over time. 

4. The barring of funds for Planned Parenthood or any insurer that offers abortions is nuts. Federal funds are already barred from funding abortions, so the only consequence will be to deprive millions of women the routine medical care they now get through Planned Parenthood.

If there were no deductible or even if there were a small one and yes, there would have to be limits on how many visits each person could have per year to prevent frivolous visits for things that can be taken care of through nutrition and homecare, would that not be enough to provide 100% coverage for everyone?  I realize there is more to health insurance than just making sure doctors are paid but it seems that 7 billion per day should be enough as not everyone is in need of costly medical attention (hospitalization, etc.) but everyone does need annual checkups and the ability to receive care for things beyond what home care can achieve.","2017-03-08T01:19:02+0000",0,1,"10158760156905725_1692338941064155"

Protect and Bless him, his family, and all of those near and dear to him, and everyone that works with him to Bless our Nation and Make America great again, AMEN!! 
      Dear Mr. President I am watching the Press Conference that took place today on Health Care, right now and what I'm hearing sounds great so far at 19 minutes in. I have one request Mr. President. First allow me to tell you a little about myself concerning my healt. I am 36 days away from turning 50 years old. I am a carpenter by trade, have been since I was 17 years old. I love that job, building house, decks, roofs, siding, boxing, framing, painting, you name it , I have done mostly all of it. I fell off a 10' step ladder in 1996 from the last step all the way down right on my butt, like I was sitting Indian style. I got up, climbed back up the ladder, finished the job and went home. It hurt but I kept going, my coworkers were laughing and teasing me after they saw I was ok, or so We thought. The next day I was unable to walk very well and was out of work for the next year because of the injury to my tailbone and spine. I was in SEVERE PAIN!! I went back to work after a year and worked until 2007- 08, until I could not stand the pain anymore. In 2009 I finally got Disability. I have been in severe pain since that fall everyday for the last 21 years this July. I didn't start pain management until 2011. I can barely get around to even go pee in the morning without pain medication. I haven't been able to take care of my yard work they way I like it done for the past 4 or 5 years now. I get worse more each year. The medication takes away the pain in the right dosage for me to be able to get up out of bed and do anything normal or just to lay back and enjoy the feeling of no pain, which is rare. With the right amount of meds I can be Aleved of pain enough to function the little everyday things everyone does, shower, dress, and just go outside without a walking cane. People who don't need this type of medication have ruined and made life very difficult and painful for people like myself who depend on medication just to get out of bed in the morning and do the everyday little things most people without pain take for granted. I know this is a long comment and I left out a lot of details, but here it is. Mr President, Sir. My request is would you allow Pain Management Dr.s to increase the dosage of immediate pain medication ( opioid) for patients like myself, the only thing that takes away the pain enough to function somewhat normally, without a cane and ooohing and aaahhing from pain every time I move or take a step from pain for the last 20 years, in my situation???? I need double what I am getting now but my Dr. says he can't prescribe that much. If he could increase it from 90 milligrams to 175, or at least 150 milligrams a day it would be like a miracle for my pain. The drug abusers who use it the wrong way and for the wrong reasons and the result from there abuse have really raked me and others like me over, big time!! Even this very minute I am in sever nerve pain in my neck, shoulder and lower back. It went all the way up my spine. I have almost 10 disc completely gone. I have my red extra large ( Trump Is My President ) T-Shirt from INFOWARS!! I finally feel hope for our future and the future for the next generations to come in America, for the first time in years. Thank. You God for President Trump!!!!! I am praying for You Sir, for God to guide you and guide us all back to Love, understanding, wisdom, health, peace, and prosperity, AMEN!!!!!","2017-03-08T05:43:43+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_777247159106433"

Those denials were not true. At least five members of his team met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump officially took office. 

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to mitigate the spiraling situation last week, telling reporters the main issue was that Trump himself had never met with any Russian government officials during the campaign.

“The big point here is the president himself knows what his involvement was, and that’s zero,” Huckabee Sanders said on March 3. “And I think that he’s the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think that’s what the story should be focused on.”

But according to a May 13, 2016 report in The Wall Street Journal noticed by AmericaBlog, Trump had at least some interaction with Kislyak on April 27, right in the midst of campaign season.

The communication happened right before Trump delivered a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.

The Wall Street Journal reported: 

“I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia—from a position of strength only—is possible, absolutely possible,” Mr. Trump said in a foreign-policy speech at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel in April. “Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out.”

A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.

It is not clear what Trump and Kislyak discussed, or how extensive the interaction was. The New York Times also recently mentioned that Kislyak had attended Trump’s speech. Dimitri Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, told the outlet he had simply introduced Trump to Kislyak in a receiving line at the hotel: 

Mr. Simes introduced Mr. Kislyak to Mr. Trump in a receiving line last April at a foreign policy speech hosted by his center at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Mr. Kislyak was one of four ambassadors who sat in the front row for Mr. Trump’s speech at the invitation of the center. Mr. Simes noted that Mr. Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, was there, but he did not notice whether he and the ambassador spoke at that time.

Neither the White House nor Simes immediately returned a request for comment. 

Trump has been unable to move on from his administration’s ties to Russia after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the Russian government had interfered in the U.S. election to help Trump defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. So far, there is no evidence of collusion between Trump’s team and the Russian government. 

But the administration has taken hits as reports come out that some of the president’s top campaign officials met with Russian officials, despite denying they had done so. Michael Flynn stepped down as national security adviser in February over the issue, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently promised to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s investigations into Russia’s meddling in the presidential race after The Washington Post reported that he had met with Russia’s ambassador twice during the campaign.

During his confirmation hearing, Sessions told senators that he “did not have communications with the Russians.”

Trump himself told NBC News on Jan. 11 that no members of his campaign staff had communicated with Russian officials.  T  RUMP BIGGEST LIAR I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE !!!!!","2017-03-08T02:59:56+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_267886806969145"

WASHINGTON — Repealing Obamacare was Republicans’ biggest campaign pledge for years, but the long-awaited bill to repeal the landmark legislation faces fierce intraparty opposition from conservatives who say it doesn’t go far enough, and they have the votes to stop it in the Senate.

The Republican leadership’s plan was to fast-track their just-released proposal to repeal Obamacare. Republican leaders want to vote on it in the House of Representatives, send it to the Senate and put it on President Donald Trump’s desk within months.

It could be their own party that stops it from happening.

In the 24 hours since an Obamacare replacement bill was announced, a slew of congressional Republicans have voiced their opposition to the plan, referring to it as “Obamacare Lite” or “Obamacare 2.0.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said his caucus would support the legislation even if a few members dissented.

“We’ll have 218 (votes) when this comes to the floor, I can guarantee it,” Ryan said.

Passing the Obamacare repeal bill is a more perilous matter in the Senate. The GOP loses its majority if three Republican senators vote against it combined with unified Democratic opposition.

So far, two conservative Republicans, Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have argued the bill doesn’t go far enough. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, an ally of Lee’s, was noncommittal when asked whether he would vote no on the bill in its current state.

“This is a step in the wrong direction, a missed opportunity,” Lee said. “This is not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for. … We don’t know how many people would use this new tax credit, we don’t know how much it will cost and we don’t know if this bill will make health care more affordable for Americans.”

Four moderate Republican senators also publicly voiced concerns Monday that the House plan does not “provide stability” for families in Medicaid expansion programs, which would be phased out under the plan. Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Monday outlining their concerns.

A variety of powerful conservative advocacy groups, including Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, blasted the bill and targeted the moderate senators for what they see as a hypocritical stance on repealing Obamacare.

“They supported a strong repeal bill when they knew President Obama would never sign it, and now they won’t support the same language because President Trump might sign it,” FreedomWorks director of campaigns Noah Wall said in a statement.

In a bid to dare Senate Republicans to vote against the bill, which has earned praise from Trump and was a key campaign promise for Republicans during the November elections, Senate leaders said they would put the House bill up for a vote immediately instead of sending it through committees.

“My guess is once it comes out of the House it will come directly to the Senate floor,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. “There’s already been a lot of consultation with Sen. Hatch, Sen. Alexander, those committees, to get us here in the first place.”

Despite the opposition, McConnell expects the bill to move quickly.

“We hope and expect to get that from the House sometime in the next few weeks,” McConnell said. “If so, it will be on the agenda in the Senate before the April recess.”

McConnell also said he expects the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress that grades the fiscal impact of legislation, to release a score on the bill later this week before the House votes on it.

The CBO did not immediately respond to a request for a timeline on scoring the bill.

But before the bill makes it to the Senate, it must pass the House. If 22 Republicans buck party leadership combined with unified Democratic opposition, the bill will fail.

One House Republican, Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia, is on record saying he will not vote for the bill.

“I can’t support it because if you look at what went wrong with Obamacare, ACA, it was a federally run program that’s now in a death spiral, and anyone could see it,” Brat told NPR on Tuesday morning. “The last thing we need to is replicate a system that doesn’t work. It’s going to be a federally run system; it’s going to create a new entitlement program. It keeps too many of the bad pieces, which will collide with each other and it will collapse.”

But Trump wants to pass something quickly. The president summoned Republican leaders to the White House and told them, “There’s going to be no slowing down, no waiting and no more excuses by anybody.”

Reps. Kevin Brady of Texas and Greg Walden of Oregon, chairmen of the committees where the bill will be marked up Wednesday, repeatedly invoked Trump’s support for the legislation during a news conference Monday, signaling that a no vote will be a vote against the president’s wishes.

Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence was dispatched to the Capitol to support the bill.

But Sen. Paul of Kentucky argued that conservative factions in Congress have the votes to derail the bill.

“The House Freedom Caucus has enormous power,” Paul said. “So do the conservatives in the Senate if they stay together.”                           THIS GUY CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT!!","2017-03-08T02:51:55+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_267884440302715"

3. He said he’d divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest.
You bought it.
He is still heavily involved in his businesses, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted.
4. He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said.
You bought it.
He then proceeded to put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.
5. He said he’d surround himself with all the best and smartest people.
You bought it.
He nominated theocratic loon Mike Pence for Vice President. A white supremacist named Steve Bannon is his most trusted confidant. Dr. Ben Carson, the world’s greatest idiot savant brain surgeon, is in charge of HUD. Russian quisling Rex Tillerson is Secretary of State.
6. He said he’d be his own man, beholden to no one.
You bought it.
He then appointed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, whose only “qualifications” were the massive amounts of cash she donated to his campaign.
7. He said he would “drain the swamp” of Washington insiders.
You bought it.
He then admitted that was just a corny slogan he said to fire up the rubes during the rallies, and that he didn’t mean it.
8. He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the Generals did.
You bought it.
He promptly gave the green light to a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though all his Generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained.
9. He said Hillary Clinton couldn’t be counted on in times of crisis.
You bought it.
He didn’t even bother overseeing that raid in Yemen; and instead spent the time hate-tweeting the New York Times, and sleeping.
10. He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times “fake news” and said they were his enemy.
You bought it.
He now gets all his information from Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.
11. He called Barack Obama “the vacationer-in-Chief” and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer’s dime, not when there was so much important work to be done.

Years ago thru Group insurance , the pre existing clause didnt matter and then it changed. Rome wasnt built in a day , they say.. and addressing this industry.. is complex. Also , The states are different ie: the preexisting clauses , the for profit companies and not for profit. In medicaid also, there are loopholes where billing is not being audited properly ; especially if Home Health Care is cancelled like in the middle or beginning of the year, unless its reported to Medicaid.. The Home Health Goverment Entities over the Home Health Care at Home Businesses do not notify Medicaid/ At least here in Texas. In my years of selling Insurance for 6 year , i concluded that a major expense is in the billing wheither private or State. Just a thought.

Starting in 2020, the plan would do away with the current system of providing premium subsidies based on people’s income and the cost of insurance where they live. Instead, it would provide tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 per year based on their age.

But the credits would not cover nearly as much of the cost of premiums as the current subsidies do, at least for the type of comprehensive coverage that the Affordable Care Act requires, analysts said. For many people, that could mean the difference between keeping coverage under the new system and having to give it up.

“The central issue is the tax credits are not going to be sufficient,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, an insurer that offers coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces in California, Florida and several other states.”","2017-03-08T04:18:58+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1852296235041086"

"841383435999809","Yau Ng","After seven years of effort, Republicans unveil a woeful health bill
03/07/17 08:00 AM
By Steve Benen
Congressional Republicans started working on their alternative to the Affordable Care Act in June 2009. That was, for those keeping score, 92 months ago. And over the course of those months, GOP leaders would periodically assure the public that their amazing reform law, written behind closed doors without so much as a hint of transparency or attempts at bipartisan cooperation, was nearly complete.

Those promises soon became the punch line to a pitiful joke. Late yesterday afternoon, however, those engaged in the health care debate stopped laughing and started reading – because the long-awaited Republican version of “Obamacare” was finally unveiled. The Huffington Post’s summary is an excellent place to start.
House Republican leaders on Monday formally unveiled legislation to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act and “replace” it with a very different health policy scheme <U+2015> one in which government would do a lot less to help people get comprehensive health insurance and, most likely, many more people would struggle to find affordable medical care. […]

The plan endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) … offers less financial assistance to low-income people, likely resulting in millions of Americans losing the health coverage they have today, and provides tax credits to people with higher incomes. The bill scraps key consumer protections.

And, crucially, the legislation is a vehicle for massive tax cuts for rich people and corporations, paid for by slashing assistance to poor and middle-class people.
As you read news accounts of the new, 66-page blueprint, you’re likely to see reports saying the law is similar to the ACA, which is true in a structural sense. “Obamacare” provides millions of consumers with subsidies to buy private insurance, and the Republican plan – “Ryancare”? “Trumpcare”? – does something similar, replacing income-based subsidies with age-based tax credits. It’s one reason many on the right are already panning the new bill as “Obamacare Lite.”

But make no mistake: this approach is a significant departure from the status quo, deliberately shifting resources away from working families and towards the wealthy. The basic outline may look similar to the ACA, but the Republican plan takes “Obamacare,” makes it less generous to Americans who need a hand, and strips consumers of valuable protections.

House GOP leaders have therefore spent more than seven years coming up with a proposal that will please almost no one and even seems to be lacking a purpose. The goal, obviously, is to scrap the Affordable Care Act, but after reading the Republican alternative, I’m not at all sure on why, exactly, GOP leaders have made this a priority.

Vox’s Ezra Klein had a good piece on this: “ ‘In general,’ writes Peter Suderman, ‘it’s not clear what problems this particular bill would actually solve.’ This is a profound point. It is difficult to say what question, or set of questions, would lead to this bill as an answer. Were voters clamoring for a bill that cut taxes on the rich, raised premiums on the old, and cut subsidies for the poor? Will Americans be happy when 15 million people lose their health insurance and many of those remaining face higher deductibles? … [T]he biggest problem this bill has is that it’s not clear why it exists. What does it make better? What is it even trying to achieve?”

Those need not be seen as rhetorical questions. Republicans have complained that the deductibles under the ACA were too high, but their new plan will push them higher. Republicans have said “Obamacare” doesn’t cover enough people, but their plan will likely take coverage from millions of Americans.

I say “likely” because we don’t yet have firm data from the Congressional Budget Office. Indeed, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his team have launched their bill in a strikingly half-assed way: Republicans, by their own admission, have no idea how much their bill will cost, no idea how many it will cover, no idea what impact the plan will have on the deficit, and no idea how to pay for the policies once they scrap existing ACA taxes.

In a Q&A published last night, House Republican leaders ask and answer a series of common questions. At one point, the document asks, “How are you paying for this plan? How much is it going to cost taxpayers?” In response, GOP officials quite literally wrote, “We are still discussing details.”

By any fair measure, this is a pitiful plan completed in a cringe-worthy way. Among stakeholders, the “American Health Care Act,” as Republicans are calling their plan, will have few, if any, champions, and its provisions contradict practically every promise Donald Trump made to the nation about how the system will look as a result of Republican policymaking.

This may help explain why the White House statement in response to the bill’s unveiling was, to be charitable, lukewarm, and included no endorsement.

There’s no shortage of moving parts to this, and I’m obviously just scratching the surface, but the process is set to move forward very quickly. Republican leaders want the first committee vote on this reform plan to be held tomorrow.

Buckle up.

Postscript: You may have heard that 6 of the bill’s 66 pages are devoted to blocking Medicaid payments to lottery winners. As odd as this may sound, that’s true, and I have no idea why GOP lawmakers are so concerned about this.

"841383435999809","Yau Ng","By pointing to piles of paper, Spicer makes the worst argument of all
03/07/17 04:57 PM
By Steve Benen
Before today’s White House press briefing got underway, aides put two piles of paper on a table near the press secretary’s podium. One was much taller than the other, and it seemed pretty obvious what was about to happen.

Sure enough, Sean Spicer delivered the punch-line to a sad and unnecessary joke: the tall pile paper was the text of the Affordable Care Act, while the short pile is the House Republicans’ new bill, called the American Health Care Act.

Apparently, the point is that the Republicans’ proposal, panned by practically everyone who isn’t an elected GOP official, is better – because it’s shorter. This was Spicer’s exact quote to reporters:
“People who have concerns about this, especially on the right, look at the size. This [puts hand on tall pile of paper] is the Democrats’; this [puts hand on short pile of paper] is us. There is, you can’t get any clearer, in terms of this [puts hand on tall pile of paper] is government; this [puts hand on short pile of paper] is not.”
Please note, this wasn’t a joke. Spicer wasn’t kidding around. In 2017, the chief spokesperson for the president of the world’s dominant superpower argued, in all seriousness, that the merit of a national health care plan can be measured in part by page numbers.

This is the status of the political discourse in contemporary American life.

And why is Spicer wrong? First, because the 66-page American Health Care Act, as unveiled last night, isn’t the entire Republican plan. It’s a modest bill that hasn’t amended or even debated, and according to none other than Donald Trump, it’s the first in a series of “phases.” The Affordable Care Act, meanwhile, is existing law that’s provided health security to tens of millions and brought the nation’s uninsured rate to the lowest point on record.

In other words, “Obamacare” is complete; “Trumpcare” is just getting started. The fact that the former will have more words in it than the latter should be obvious to anyone above the age of six.

Second, the adage “it’s easier to tear down than build up” comes to mind. The Affordable Care Act overhauled the health care system in a country of more than 315 million people. That takes time, effort, and a whole lot of legislative text.

Republicans want to piggyback on the existing framework, make coverage more expensive, cut the number of people with health security, and deliver a big tax cut to the wealthy. That takes less time, less effort, and far fewer pages.

For years, various voices on the right have tried to argue, “The ACA can’t be good because it’s long.” In Grown-Up Land, however, word-counts are a ridiculous metric for legislative merit.

As we discussed a few years ago, when opponents of a bill are reduced to talking about the literal, physical size of the legislation, they’ve completely given up on the pretense that public policy matters. When they’re more inclined to put a bill on a scale than actually read the bill and evaluate its real-world impact, they’ve embraced post-policy anti-intellectualism with both arms.

Meeting at odds with spokeswoman’s denial of any contacts
Event resurfaces amid attention to aides’ Russia encounters
President Donald Trump met last April with the Russian ambassador at the center of a pair of controversies over engagement between Trump allies and the Kremlin, despite claims by his spokeswoman that he had ""zero"" involvement with Russian officials during the campaign.
Attention to Trump’s encounter with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak resurfaced after revelations last week that at least five members of Trump’s campaign team - including Attorney General Jeff Sessions - had contact with Kislyak before Trump took office.
The federal government has launched multiple investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential contacts between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
Trump met Kislyak during a VIP reception April 27 at the Mayflower Hotel shortly before a foreign policy address, according to a report at the time in the Wall Street Journal.

"942715529197871","Michelle Lee Vrieze","Thank you for doing what you can to #MAGA. The one issue I have with this new bill is the fact that there is this 30% fine or fee that is given to those who have not paid for insurance. Granted there are some who are mooches who refuse to pay. 

However, Mr. President, there are those who have had a hard hand dealt to them. For instance perhaps they were on their parent's insurance and they were diagnosed with something(s) whether a physical ailment or a mental disorder or whatever. 

Now such people are still on their parent's insurance so all is well. Then one day they no longer are but instead end up on free health care. Perhaps someone might say, ""Get a job!"" Yet keep in mind it is not that such people do not want a job but cannot get a job whether it is because of some physical ailment or mental disorder or whatever. It is not because they are mooches, lazy, or anything else. 

Take for instance you have Michael, let's say  he was on his parent's insurance. He gets an unexpected seizure at the age of 25. Later he is diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder. So he has to get his medicines regulated and that, for anyone who takes medicine fully knows, takes time. It isn't something that happens in a week. Sometimes it take months or even years. He does not get a job because he cannot get one because he may have a seizure and further because of his APD it makes him very anxious to even speak to someone. 

So the time comes and he is now 26 and no longer on his parent's insurance. However, because of the cruel hand he was dealt, he does not get a job. So he goes on assistance. Then later he improves and after much help, counseling, etc. he finally is able to apply for a job. However, there are none available. Then years later he is able to get a job. 

However, he finds out that he has to pay this 30% fee, this penalty because for a period he did not have his own health insurance. He didn't pay for it. 

Now, if such be the case, with all due respect that doesn't seem very fair to Michael or to anyone else in that situation. Through absolutely no fault of his own something happens to him and is put  in one lousy situation. 

So please keep that in mind people like Michael. 

Please Mr. President keep in mind all those who were unfairly dealt a cruel hand. Please do not allow such to be punished for something they didn't choose to have and for things they have through no fault of their own.

"733651326808870","Maxi Lee","Please don't remove Medicaid expansions . The one good part of Obamacare is the Medicaid expansion, as it cares for people that can't afford to care for themselves. It also helps the economy because people lose jobs when they can't afford to go to the doctor. In addition, if people can't afford care, they end up in the ER which prevents patients with real emergencies getting help. It also increases hospital bills for patients who can afford insurance because low income folks without insurance can't pay their ER bills. Emergency Rooms are not allowed to refuse treating someone who can't pay, so taxpayers end up paying the bill which is three times what it would have been if they had Medicaid. If low income folks are able to get the care they need, their issues will not escalate to ER visits. When businesses were forced to provide medical care for employees who worked a certain number of hours, most employers just cut their hours so they wouldn't have to pay for employees medical care. This has left millions of Americans with less money, due to getting less hours, AND no medical insurance. The Medicaid expansion addresses this issue and has enabled millions of American families to remain healthy enough to continue working and providing for their families. If Medicaid is cut, lower income people will lose their jobs due to lost time, due to illness, many will even end up disabled, which again will cost taxpayers much more than it would have cost them for Medicaid. The Republican establishment as always been against caring for the poor and the lower income folks and they don't realize that cutting Medicaid would ruin our economy. It isn't people who don't work that get Medicaid, it is people who can't afford medical insurance when their employer doesn't value their employees enough to provide them with insurance.","2017-03-08T04:06:28+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1026305550847035"

"1877615372522243","Franklin Gudelia","Buried in the GOP bill to ""replace"" the Affordable Care Act is a provision ending the $500,000 limit on deducting executive compensation from health insurer’s taxes.
As a result, health insurance companies would get a $1 billion or more windfall over the next decade — and pay their CEOs even more money than now.
For example, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini earns more than $17 million annually, of which $500,000 is deducted from Aetna’s corporate income as a business expense. Ending the cap would allow Aetna to deduct the entire $17 million, as well as the pay of all other Aetna executives earning more than $500,000 a year.
Remember, this is only one small provision in the Republican bill. Add them up, and we’re talking big money – transferred from the poor and sick to the rich and wealthy, from taxpayers to health insurers.
It makes no sense to have a health insurance system based on private for-profit health insurers -- who pay vast sums to their executives, and even vaster sums in order to market and advertise to healthy people, and whose only real goal is to maximize shareholder returns.
That’s why we must work toward a single-payer system.

03/07/17 01:00 PM—UPDATED 03/07/17 01:10 PM
By Steve Benen
House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has made quite a name for himself lately. The Utah Republican has gone to almost comical lengths to avoid scrutiny of Donald Trump’s many controversies, while simultaneously latching on to trivia, which he’s labeled “serious.”

Yesterday, true to form, Chaffetz responded to the president’s new wiretap conspiracy theory by telling Fox News, “The Obama administration has been notorious on this type of stuff, and we’re going to look hard at it.” In reality, the Obama administration hasn’t been notorious for anything of the kind, and even Chaffetz conceded he’s seen no evidence to bolster Trump’s claims.

This morning, as the Huffington Post noted, the GOP lawmaker was once again in the spotlight, this time making the case for his party’s woeful health care reform proposal.
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) is proposing a quick fix for low-income Americans unable to afford coverage under President Donald Trump’s newly proposed health care law: Don’t buy an iPhone.

The American Health Care Act, unveiled by House Republican leaders Monday, offers less financial assistance to low-income people than former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, so it would likely result in millions of Americans losing the health coverage they have today.

But the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Tuesday that Americans who might struggle to afford insurance under the GOP plan simply need to make the choice to “invest in health care.”
Specifically, Chaffetz told CNN, “Americans have choices, and they’ve got to make a choice. So rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions themselves.”

Later this morning, he added on Fox News, “Maybe I didn’t say it as smoothly as I could.”

Perhaps not, but the congressman nevertheless touched on a common point of concern among conservatives, which helped drive the blueprint of the new GOP plan.

On its face, Chaffetz’s argument is plainly foolish. A new iPhone costs several hundred dollars, while decent health care insurance costs several thousand dollars a year. For a congressman who enjoys a generous, taxpayer-financed salary and benefits package to suggest low-income Americans should give up their smart phones in order to buy health security is misguided.

But I think there’s also an assumption among many on the right that struggling Americans have themselves to blame, and the poor are simply making bad decisions with their available resources. Chaffetz’s on-air comments to CNN are practically a caricature of the sentiment: maybe struggling families would be able to buy their own coverage, without government aid, the argument goes, if only they didn’t bother with a smart phone.

It’s a perspective predicated on the idea that low-income families would be in better shape if they reprioritized. It’s also why GOP lawmakers routinely vote to cut food stamps and unemployment benefits.

I understand that voting decisions are often irrational, but I’ll look forward to the public reactions to news that the Republican health care plan directs resources from the bottom up, gives the wealthy a big tax break, undermines working families’ health security, and its defenders are asking the poor to take care of themselves by forgoing iPhone purchases.

"233608693776311","Oliver Holmes","While I would like to see truly affordable health care, the current bill has problems. For one, the short term and long term funding for the services provided seem inadequate. In any Business, there are Fundamental Units and there are the Accessory Units.

In the health care system, the Fundamental Units are (1)Patients (those who need healthcare) and (2)Doctors (those who directly provide  health care).   
The Accessory Units are the Health Insurance Companies, Health Benefit Plans. The Accessory Units are extraneous, nonessential and exist for convenience of the Fundamental Units.  

For any industry to survive, the Fundamental Units must survive. 
And in order to survive, the Fundamental Unit musts  observe the simple economic formula that the Income must be equal to or greater than Expenditure.  Mathematically, this is the equation: I > = E, where I = Income,  E = Expenditures, and >= represents  “greater or equal to.”

Obama failed to keep this equation in mind. And this is what doomed his PPACA (“Obamacare”) to failure:  The Health Insurance Administrators (they are part of the Accessory Units) wanted to maximize their profit as much as possible. And they did this by diverting the Cash Flow as much as they could to themselves by increasing the cost to the Patients (co-pays, premiums, deductibles) and diminishing the payment to the Doctors. As a result, the Health Insurance Administrators effectively diverted the Cash Flow from the Fundamental Units to the Accessory Units. This resulted in both the Patients and Doctors being squeezed and the breakdown of the Fundamental Units.  And with the breakdown of the Fundamental Units came the breakdown of Obamacare and its demise.  

The current bill has no safeguards to protect the Fundamental Units and prevent their breakdown and collapse.  So, it would only be a matter of time before the American Healthcare bill meets the same fate as Obamacare wherein Patients will pay more for their health care service, but receive less health care. And the Patients will need to turn to federal subsidies in order to survive.  The Doctors, in turn, would receive less payment for the services they provide. This in turn will result in Doctors either providing  less service or making  greater errors to compensate for a greater workload. And the Doctors may likely consider an early career change and get out of the medical field entirely in order to make a living. Some of the Doctors may end up on federal subsidies too. The end result ultimately would be an increase in government subsidies and bailouts which would destroy any hope for an economic recovery.

Summing up:  The Fundamental Units must be protected if the American Health Care bill is to be survive and be viable.  Right now, the Accessory Units are receiving most of the Cash Flow and letting the Fundamental Units die.","2017-03-08T00:46:05+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_10158760309925725"

We never knew what President Obama was doing.
All we saw was him playing golf, going on vacation every few months, and did he work or not?
I don't know.
He did not act like a CEO.
Frankly, he doesn't know how!
He was a lack luster Illinois US senator who mostly voted ""Present"" when he was in the Illinois Senate in Springfield.
He was picked (my opinion) in 2008 because much of the Democratic Party did NOT want Hillary Clinton because they knew of her past scandals.
Obama probably gave her Secetary of State job as a consolation prize and to keep her out of his hair by letting her travel most of the time.

"275371592887392","Joy Z Cohen","Buried in the GOP bill to ""replace"" the Affordable Care Act is a provision ending the $500,000 limit on deducting executive compensation from health insurer’s taxes.

As a result, health insurance companies would get a $1 billion or more windfall over the next decade — and pay their CEOs even more money than now. 

For example, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini earns more than $17 million annually, of which $500,000 is deducted from Aetna’s corporate income as a business expense. Ending the cap would allow Aetna to deduct the entire $17 million, as well as the pay of all other Aetna executives earning more than $500,000 a year. 

Remember, this is only one small provision in the Republican bill. Add them up, and we’re talking big money – transferred from the poor and sick to the rich and wealthy, from taxpayers to health insurers. 

It makes no sense to have a health insurance system based on private for-profit health insurers -- who pay vast sums to their executives, and even vaster sums in order to market and advertise to healthy people, and whose only real goal is to maximize shareholder returns.","2017-03-08T01:12:18+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1904875623059303"

"10155038801383536","Delray Richardson","Donald J. Trump is a fraud and everything  Donald J. Trump said on the campaign trail was a lie. And the latest lying statement with (no proof) we heard from Donald Trump is ""President Obama tapped my phones at Trump Tower during the election."" The next lie we found out about was, attorney general Jeff Sessions lied under oath at his confirmation hearing.  If members of the Armed Services  Committee meet with ambassador's everyday or it's commonplace to do so. Then why would Jeff Sessions lie under oath and say ""NO""  when asked this question, ""Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?” Sessions outright lied when he answered ""NO"",  Sessions also lied when asked by Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, ""what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign.""

“I’m not aware of any of those activities,” he responded. He added: “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” That was an outright lie. Officials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers’ questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak. Donald J. Trump also lied about the raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen that resulted in the deaths of  Navy SEAL Ryan Owens and multiple women and children did not produce any meaningful intelligence, after Sean Spicer lied in a press conference saying that it did, according to senior U.S. officials .... Donald Trump also said he would have a plan in 30 days to defeat ISIS, according to 33 days later, ""that was a lie."" Donald J. Trump said ""somebody gave him those Electoral College numbers"" that he lied about to our face on national television. Donald J. Trump also lied in 2012 when he said, “I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate.” Then on January 22nd 2017 after lying seven times saying he would release his taxes, Kellyanne Conway released a statement saying, ""People didn't care,"" despite over a million people signing a petition contradicting that lying statement. As a candidate, Donald Trump told LGBT voters, ""I will fight for you,"" he lied, On Feb 22,2017 Trump rescinded transgender protections signed by Barack Obama. Donald J. Trump is an illegitimate president and a fraud, who is profiting off of his presidency. Donald J. Trump has violated the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bans presidents from receiving payments from foreign countries. Donald J. Trump is incapable of taking responsibility for his own words, even when he's caught lying to the people and/or the media to their face. Donald J. Trump has just been hit up in the song titled illegitimate president... it's the most controversial song since Tupac's Hit Em Up.. The artist has cleverly woven a tale of Donald Trump's hypocrisies. From Trump's lack of military service to his claim of voter fraud, this song embodies everything that is wrong with Trump being the President of the United States: http://www.loupdargent.info/2017/02/donald-trump-has-just-been-hit-up-in.html","2017-03-08T00:34:53+0000",1,1,"10158760156905725_10158760268820725"

President Trump's Unaffordable Care Act,DJT

You people have shown your stupidities in that Rep Paul Ryan wanted to use Vouchers way back when that Democrats didn't agree with because it wouldn't cover the costs of Healthcare when you should have known better but voted the cold,clammy Republicans in anyways. We see you have used his idea to use Tax credits to replace Government Subsidies similar to Rep Paul Ryan's (R) (WI) stupid Voucher idea which will not be nearly enough to pay for expensive Lifesaving Healthcare for Cancers,etc. 

Furthermore, even more poignantly sad is people of all Trades,Clerical,Veterans, Entry level job positions,janitors,cleaning women,cannot save up much money to use for expensive Healthcare and Lifesaving surgeries nor hardly anyone can afford expensive Healthcare except the Rich. So why the slant to help the Rich!

Moreover, your cutting out much funding as well in cutting The expanded Medicaid Insurance program. So sad and cold and uncompassionate all this is. 

If this was your idea of Replacement to cut and replace The Affordable Care Act,ACA with much less money The Government subsidies and Medicaid then it is so tragically sad. You Republicans won't donate any money either then to save someone's life I gather. The word tragic no longer means to you saving a life so no tragic medical emergency happens.  

It is a compassionate and empathetic and wonderful and smart thing to save the life of oneself and save lives of others.

So everything you’ll hear from Republicans is a ruse. The real result of the Republican bill:

1. Millions of lower-income people will lose their coverage because the refundable tax credits won’t go far enough.

2. People with pre-existing conditions won’t be covered because insurance companies will demand extraordinarily high premiums, co-payments, and deductibles. 

3. Medicaid will no longer be available for millions, because it’s turned into a block grant to states that’s phased out over time. 

4. The barring of funds for Planned Parenthood or any insurer that offers abortions is nuts. Federal funds are already barred from funding abortions, so the only consequence will be to deprive millions of women the routine medical care they now get through Planned Parenthood.

03/07/17 11:20 AM—UPDATED 03/07/17 02:16 PM
By Steve Benen
In many ways, calling out politicians for hypocrisy is almost too easy. Worse, hypocrisy is so common, it can be boring to talk about.

But once in a while, the dynamic is so strong, and so jarring, even the most jaded and cynical of political observers have to pause and take note. Consider, for example, how House Republicans are proceeding with their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.
Two House committees — Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce — plan to start reviewing the legislation this week. The bill must also move through the Budget and Rules committees before the full House can vote on it. Republican leaders say they want that to happen before Congress’ spring break begins April 7.
Committee votes are likely begin as early as tomorrow.

And on the surface, that’s plainly crazy. Lawmakers have no idea what the Republican bill costs, how many it will cover, how many Americans will lose their insurance, or what the impact will be on the budget deficit. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hopes to rush the process to prevent everyone – voters, reporters, lawmakers, stakeholders, et al – from coming to terms with just how bad a bill he’s produced, so committees are poised to vote on a blueprint members know little about.

But just below the surface, the picture looks even less flattering. For years, Republicans have complained bitterly that when “Obamacare” was coming together, Democrats wrote the bill behind closed doors, then rushed it through the legislative process. In reality, that’s never been altogether fair – the ACA was publicly available for a month before a single vote was cast, and it was the subject of 130 hearings across the five committees, all as part of a debate that lasted over a year – but we nevertheless now see the same lawmakers who whined writing a bill in private and trying to jam it down everyone’s throats.

Republicans said the ACA was written without bipartisan input, which isn’t true, and which hasn’t stopped them from writing their alternative plan without even trying to solicit bipartisan input.

Republicans said deductibles are too high under the ACA, which led them to write a bill in which deductibles will be even higher.

Republicans said it was an outrageous abuse to pass elements of the ACA through the budget reconciliation process, and yet here we are, watching them try to push their own reform bill through the budget reconciliation process.

Republicans attacked “Obamacare” for not reaching universal coverage, and now they’re embracing a plan that would make the uninsured rate worse, not better.

New York’s Jon Chait had a piece in early January, highlighting the irony: “[T]he claims that conservatives have falsely made about passing Obamacare provide a true description of the Republican plan to undo it.”

There are all sorts of reasons to balk at the GOP health care plan. Save a little space on the list for the breathtaking hypocrisy on display.

The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The Coast Guard’s $9.1 billion budget in 2017 would be cut 14 percent to about $7.8 billion, while the TSA and FEMA budgets would be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.","2017-03-08T03:10:03+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_188616694961434"

Page says that trip was to give a commencement speech at the New Economic School, but the U.S. intelligence community believes that Page met with “top Russian officials” including former deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, the head of state-owned oil giant Rosneft and Sergei Ivanov, Putin’s chief of staff.

That assumption of chain of succession is based off of a legitimate election. But what if the election wasn't legitimate? That creates a constitutional crisis. And it's one we need to fight for the right resolution should this come to pass. The rightful winner, Hillary Clinton should be made President. And if forced to compromise, the only thing to accept should be a re-do election with Hillary and Pence.

"10212583560531055","Will Adams","Being a staunch Trump supporter, I was HORRIFIED at what a scam the Republican heatlhcare plan is. Do you know that it does the following? Hidden in the Bill, is that It allows Healthcare CEO's to unlimited compensation, & guess you will pay for it? THE TAXPAYERS! It is based on Tax Credits, which increase & increase with age & income, to the point that many will have their Tax Credits nearly or TOTALLY taken from them! This is NOT what Trump promised, yet he has stated on national TV today on how he totally approves of it, and it gets rid of the awful Obamacare failure. I'm now seriously reexamining what this man is all about. He is NOT following through with his promises to his base, and, so far, FOX News is not speaking much of anything about all this, but simply praising it. Not in a thousand years did I ever think I would need to seriously examine what Trump & dirty Ryan & his cohorts are doing to scam the American people. This is beyond anything I ever anticipated. We have all been FLEECED!

For example, my friend who is 56 and earns $75,000, will have his Tax Credits reduced to an abdominably low amount, to the point that he, & many, many others will be paying a fortune for their healthcare, WORSE than the Obamacare abortion. SHAME ON YOU, TRUMP & your Republican machine who have produced this wretched piece of legislation, and then try and pawn it off as so wonderful, when it is a complete snow job and piece of trash! Those of us who are conservatives need to wake up and vigorously oppose this. Want to receive some tiny amount for your healthcare and have to pay the rest out of your pocket, if you can even afford it?

Here are some figures. Here's how the tax credit amounts would change for an older enrollee in a high cost market like Mobile, Alabama, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Under the ACA in 2017, for exchange plans:

60-year old with $20,000 income now gets $13,200
60-year old with $40,000 income now gets $10,100
60-year old with $60,000 income now gets $0
Under the GOP's tax credit proposal, for any individual market plan:

60-year old with $20,000 income would get $4,000 (70% less than under ACA)
60-year old with $40,000 would get $4,000 (60% less than under ACA)
60-year old with earning up to $75,000 would get $4,000
But under the GOP plan, insurers would also be allowed to charge 60-year olds rates up to 5 times higher than those for younger people. Under the ACA, older enrollees are charged only 3 times as much.

Analysts at S&P Global estimate that the GOP insurance changes could result in 20 percent cheaper plans for young people in their 20s, and increase premiums by 30 percent for people in their 60s, who would likely then drop coverage. S&P sees a net reduction of 2 to 4 million in individual market enrollment.

"185197981973703","Robert Ricci","PRICE OF THE HEALTHCARE INCREASE UNDER THE GOP HEALTHCARE PLAN

If the GOP proposal for healthcare reform were to pass and become fully implemented tomorrow, Vox estimates that Americans would pay an average cost of $1,542 more every year. But by 2020, when the proposed tax credits kick in, enrollees in new health insurance plans would be paying an average of $2,409 more every year.

However, if you shrunk the sample to just include older Americans — who don’t yet qualify for Medicare but will likely use their insurance more than younger Americans — the costs rise exponentially. People aged 55 to 64 could expect to pay $5,269 more each year if the bill went into effect in 2017, and $6,971 by 2020, according to Vox’s calculations.

Perhaps the harshest increase in healthcare costs, in terms of who pays, Americans living below 250 percent of the federal poverty line ($29,700/year if you’re single, $40,050 if married) will see their healthcare costs balloon to a large percentage of their annual income, and could expect to be paying an average of $2,945 more per year right now, and $4,061 more by 2020.

We still have a divided House. Not one true leader looking out for ALL Americans. Health Care for you, your family and all your loved ones, should be priority number one. Life is all we have and it's to short. IMHO you are tearing down a skyscraper when only a few floors need upgrading. The Bill that came out yesterday is not on the square & level as I see it for all Folks living in our great nation. I do not see anyone in our party being a true Leader reaching out to the otherside. So you need to act and be that trun & only leader that we need now that can be reaching out, and showing our party how it is done. Make the deal & show a act of faith within 1st fifty days of your office that dems/rep/ind all will be happy with. I think and know it can be done, our party might be a little upset in the short run, but history will change and America will be great again. 
First and foremost I would of hope by now I would of seen at least one strong independent republican take a leadership role and defy the Whip, and work together with any Dem/Ind to make ACA even better and stronger than it is already for all Folks in the USA. ACA is working very well here in California and the overall rate increases over the last 10 years have been the best that I have seen for large group, small group, individual health plans and even self funded plans. Those states that are not working out, need a change. I am still asking to see the rates in those states for a 25 year old Male? Outside of ACA for a Gold plan PPO, HMO, EPO, HSA? I also want to know the cost in those same States for that same 25 year old Male outside of ACA with that $10,000 deductible health plan that they all keep referring too? Not one, not even one, so upsetting year after year.. I am so baffled and sadden with my party leadership. <eom> feel free to edit as you wish","2017-03-08T04:31:02+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1904046799871419"

Throughout both processes it has been so apparent that there is a conspiracy to disrupt your presidency and try to ruin you.  Mainstream media - CNN( Blitzer, Bash and Tapper to name a few)  , MSNBC, New York Times and many FAKE news outlets are biased news outlets, never report fairly and are obviously determined to do what they are paid to do and that is to undo you.  Now the media is  even trying  to pursuade Trump supporters  to not back you  .  They are trying to disrupt your base supporters.  ;Paid protesters assault Trump supporters and try to make it look like the entire country is in chaos (No, only the protesters are disruters)'; AND, of course the Democrats in Congress/ Senate.  They are bound and determined not to support any of your policies you put forward. The Democrats only think of what is good for their party, NOT what is good for America  ..What  is also sad is  that there are some Republican members of Congress/ Senate that appear weak and may not support you or the party.  Finally, this whole thing about wiretapping...of course there was some sort of wiretap or surveillance or how else would there have been any information about Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador?  Of course, it has already been determined nothing criminal was done by Flynn or anyone else. Whether the wire was set up on Flynn or a suspicious foreign citizen/govt is something to consider.  Anyway,  The intelligence community cannot and should not release classified information learned from those wiretaps due to national security. Again ,it has already been determined no one in your administraton has done anything wrong.  But the Dems and these other conspirators cannot let it go..remember, they do not want YOU to succeed as President.  These colluders attack your staff and cabinet members trying to foil our govt.

"10155044966867433","Massimo Mascoli","Let's do this, let's test Ryancare ONLY on Trumpets and on the Republican Congress first. Let's them use Ryancare at the place of their ""Universal Heather Care"" plan the Congress offers to them.

When I go back to Western Europe I might wait 30 min at the hospital if not urgent to see a doctor, I pay nothing including surgeries. My mother 4 times cancer survivor with 14 surgeries is 90 years old and not bankrupt there .... here in America I have to wait 2 months for a neurologist which is in my insurance net ... and I have a theoretically a ""very good"" United Heath Care plan. I had to pay $650 for hospital bill just to check my ears.

NOTE: I still have a mother alive at the age of 90 and not bankrupt ... I hope you can afford that if your mother has 4 cancers and 14 surgeries  in America ... I doubt.

One more note, IDIOT LOW INCOME TRUMPETS, in America you pay public taxes and private taxes (premiums, deductibles and loans) .... let's do some math.

If you earn 40k in Western Europe you pay progressive taxes based on income so you pay 32% in public taxes which include 4 week paid holidays, all the benefits, paid sick days, universal health care, tuition free college, and you are not in debt even during economic crisis because you have a safety net.

In America you pay 25% in public taxes with no benefits .... THEN YOU PAY 25-30-50-70% in private taxes  (deductibles, premiums, loans) and you are in debt for life and if an economic crisis comes or a cancer or high premiums you go bankrupt, because the 80% of your premiums and loans don't go in your insurance or college ... but in the salaries and bonuses of the insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and college CEOS.

"1871984703085705","Ann Austin","Jay Clayton, who Donald Trump has nominated for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has spent his career as a Wall Street insider lobbying for Goldman Sachs and Barclays. Now he’s in line to police the same banks whose greed and recklessness led us to the 2008 global economic meltdown, the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression. Trump said that he would be tougher on our large financial institutions, holding them accountable and making the system more fair for the middle class and working Americans. During his campaign, he said that Wall Street and Washington were part of the same corrupt system that only he could take down. Yet the evidence proves him to be as corrupt and unbeholden to the American people as the political opponents that he vilified on the campaign trail. Clayton’s ties to Wall Street are deep. His law firm specializes in protecting Wall Street banks, and during the financial crisis he worked as a bailout attorney for Goldman Sachs, where his wife works today as a partner. The SEC chair is supposed to referee Wall Street banks, but Clayton has spent his entire career protecting their interests - and more than half of his family income currently comes from one of them. How can he be trusted to suddenly switch sides and put working Americans first?

Now you have the same real power. Politics as usual or fix it? The people voted you in to repeal The Act Mr. President, if you want to fix it, end Medicaid and Medicare, it's got to were we can't afford free medical. How many people are on the affordable care acts plans, 7 million out of 300+ million Americans. The only people with anything worth getting are the people who do not have insurance coverage, the rest have it for free (via the tax payers) or thur the company they work for.

"275371592887392","Joy Z Cohen","Buried in the GOP bill to ""replace"" the Affordable Care Act is a provision ending the $500,000 limit on deducting executive compensation from health insurer’s taxes.

As a result, health insurance companies would get a $1 billion or more windfall over the next decade — and pay their CEOs even more money than now. 

For example, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini earns more than $17 million annually, of which $500,000 is deducted from Aetna’s corporate income as a business expense. Ending the cap would allow Aetna to deduct the entire $17 million, as well as the pay of all other Aetna executives earning more than $500,000 a year. 

Remember, this is only one small provision in the Republican bill. Add them up, and we’re talking big money – transferred from the poor and sick to the rich and wealthy, from taxpayers to health insurers. 

It makes no sense to have a health insurance system based on private for-profit health insurers -- who pay vast sums to their executives, and even vaster sums in order to market and advertise to healthy people, and whose only real goal is to maximize shareholder returns.","2017-03-08T01:12:40+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_801308160020923"

Also locked in the 'Weeping Angel' scoop scope is John Kerry- the US Secretary of State between 2013-2017 and also in New Zealand's case- Christopher Finlayson, the GCSB Minister, exposed by Edward Snowden illegally spying on NZers and Pacific Island leaders and god only knows who else, just after the 2014 NZ general election debacle. And when combined with the specific 2013-2016 time line of the Vault 7 spying and add the allegations that Obama and the controversial FBI director were involved in illegally bugging Trump Tower, everything seems to be on track for the greatest singular global presidential scandal to ever confront the Obama PR machine. I doubt that the left wing media or any US or World fake news for that matter can even begin to cover up this unfolding presidential scandal up, without proving their bias vs many angry citizens vs Obama. Wikileaks has changed the balance of power with Obama, Brennan, Kerry and Finlayson on their own vs the public outrage once V7 is understood.

Infant Death Rates indicate Vaccines Kill 16,000/year.

JASON HOMMEL·WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2016
Infant death rates show vaccines kill.
Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there a biochemical or synergistic toxicity?To me, the study suggests that vaccines are responsible for the higher infant death rate. This could be as much as 4/1000 deaths, or more, which is 1/250, or expressed another way, is 16,000 deaths across the 4 million babies born each year in the USA. The study does not mention these numbers, they are my own.
The pro vaccine people try to say this study is ""debunked"" or proven wrong by the following blog post by an ""Orac"" of ""respectful insolence"":","2017-03-08T03:00:04+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1026264750851115"

"1387252811297062","Caroline Snyder","VAULT 7 Press Release.. by WIKILEAKS.. how TRUMP was ""monitored"" by the CIA - via his Smartphone, computer, phones and more. This is horrifying and it IS all the hallmarks of the Police State.. SPYING DOCUMENTS? We are ALL open to this spy activity.. Vault 7 shows you how they do it.. Google Vault 7 .. this is UNconstitutional and we are ALL affected! Trump MUST scour this agency as a PRIORITY! CNN won't TOUCH this massive story because CNN, NBC, MSNBC, New York Times.. are part of The Establishment.. 

Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.

The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.

Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.

By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ""weaponized"" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ""own NSA"" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.

In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.

Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.

Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of ""Year Zero"" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.""

Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the ""Year Zero"" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published.

Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in ""Year Zero"" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in ""Vault 7"" part one (“Year Zero”) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/ #Vault7","2017-03-08T01:13:54+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_618647835005032"

"1877711362466369","Laurie Beam","So here is  Noah Feldman of Bloomberg news trying to lump President Trump in the same category as Obama for impeachment.  Basically, what he is saying is that if President Trump is wrong about the wire tapping that he can be impeached and that he could also be sued for libel.  His assertions are completely inaccurate.  He obviously doesn't understand libel, so why is he writing about it? A really shoddy, crummy, and of course BIASED article.  I hope his career gets ruined over it.                                                                                                            ""When candidate Trump said Hillary Clinton was a criminal who belonged in prison, he was exposing himself to a libel suit. And the suit might not have succeeded, because Trump could have said he was making a political argument rather than an allegation of fact.

But when President Trump accuses Obama of an act that would have been impeachable and possibly criminal, that’s something much more serious than libel. If it isn’t true or provable, it’s misconduct by the highest official of the executive branch.""    https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-06/trump-s-wiretap-tweets-raise-risk-of-impeachment?cmpid=yhoo.headline#","2017-03-08T05:22:40+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_1647196865586970"

He tricked us by orchestrating the Financial Crisis of 2008 and blaming it on President Bush. WE WERE HAD. OBAMA along with several of his Democratic friends such as Chris Dodds, orchestrated this Financial Crisis to insure OBAMA the Presidency and cause the American capitalist system to collapse into socialism. This shocking state of affairs is on the Internet,on www.Americanthinker.com, ""Barack Obama and the Strategy of Manufactured Crisis."" By James Simpson, President Reagan's economic advisor.  This theory of Orchestrated Crisis was introduced to OBAMA while he was a student at Columbia. Cloward and Piven introduced this concept of forcing political change through orchestrated crisis resulting in the fall of capitalism by overloading the government bureaucracy with a flood of impossible demands thus pushing society into crisis and economic collapse.                                                                       Obama was at Columbia University studying under Cloward and Piven, two radical socialist professors who sought to use highly trained aggressive organizers assisted by friendly NEWS MEDIA to force the re-distribution of the nation's wealth.
Firstly,they concentrated on the WELFARE SYSTEM in an effort to increase welfare payments and BANKRUPT society by changing welfare from a temporary expedient to a lifetime of entitlement.
Secondly,ACORN-Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now- was established to DESTABILIZE the BANKING SYSTEM by forcing banks to make risky housing loans.
Barack Obama was ACORN'S attorney and he helped expand the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The Act was called: ""a vast extortion scheme against the nation's banks"" by PhD economist and former Senator, Phil Gramm.
ACORN was also involved in mobilizing the vote by illegal means and by making the system difficult to police by getting minimum identification standards.
Finally, the Fannie Mae Crisis was allowed to develop. The Government sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were permitted to underwrite risky mortgage investments from other banks, creating the conditions that lead to the Financial Crisis of 2008.

If Trump would have falsely accused of a crime he would have insisted that the authorities prosecute the accuser for making a false accusation. He would also sue for slander and defamation.

On March 15th, each of us will mail Donald Trump a postcard that publicly expresses our support to him. And we, in vast numbers, from all corners of the world, will overwhelm the man with our support and belief in him. We will show the media and the politicians we are standing with him.

And most importantly, we will bury the White House post office with complete support of our President, who we are honored that he was willing to take on this job.

Each of us — every supporter from every march, each volunteer, donor, and petition signer — if each of us writes even a single postcard and we put them all in the mail on the same day, March 15th, well: you do the math.

So sharpen your wit, unsheathe your writing implements, and see if your sincerest wishes can encourage and support our President
Prepare for March 15th, 2017, a day hereafter to be ""wesupportyoumrpresident

Write one postcard. Write a dozen! Take a picture and post it on social media.

Then, on March 15th, mail your messages to:
President Donald J. Trump
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500

"753763154793043","Leslie Sam","""Buried in the GOP bill to ""replace"" the Affordable Care Act is a provision ending the $500,000 limit on deducting executive compensation from health insurer’s taxes.

As a result, health insurance companies would get a $1 billion or more windfall over the next decade — and pay their CEOs even more money than now. 

For example, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini earns more than $17 million annually, of which $500,000 is deducted from Aetna’s corporate income as a business expense. Ending the cap would allow Aetna to deduct the entire $17 million, as well as the pay of all other Aetna executives earning more than $500,000 a year. 

Remember, this is only one small provision in the Republican bill. Add them up, and we’re talking big money – transferred from the poor and sick to the rich and wealthy, from taxpayers to health insurers. 

It makes no sense to have a health insurance system based on private for-profit health insurers -- who pay vast sums to their executives, and even vaster sums in order to market and advertise to healthy people, and whose only real goal is to maximize shareholder returns. 

That’s why we must work toward a single-payer system.

"1173533856101794","Anthony Foreman","I commend the new approaches to remedy and bring stronger cohesion to our need for National Healthcare Reform which began with Obama.  I think the Patient and State Stability Fund set to begin in 2019(?) could very well be a smooth transition.  I am a bit resistant to giving all the power at this national level of government, not from distrust of government, but because each State has its' very unique problems and mechanisms on how Healthcare is delivered to Individuals.  If I understand correctly the source of funding from the Government will be overseen by The Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The dispersal of Funds to all 50 States will be the responsibility of an ""Administrator"" (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services).  Is this not too large a task for a reasonably small group of Government?  In California there exists a Major Risk Medical Insurance Program (MRMIP).  That primarily deals with assuring Healthcare Options and Plans for people with Disabilities, Pre-Existing Conditions, and Chronic Diseases, etc.  Insurance companies as we know traditionally avoid these groups or want to charge them an unreasonable Monthly Premium, high Deductible, and high Co-Pays for their routine office visits to Specialists and for Medications.  I think that if a symbiotic relationship between Social Security and Medicare supporting all the States and each State (through intelligent use of Taxation which is unavoidable) instituting their own Major Risk Program would alleviate the overall  cost to the National Budget and would just be easier to manage.  Every State would still benefit from the ""Use of Funds"" Section, but would give the Insurance Companies an even greater incentive to provide all citizens in their State with affordable (based on income, standard of living, whatever) Healthcare Plans that are conducive to their needs since they will be reimbursed more thoroughly.  If the powers that be can resolve the issues of Pre-Existing Conditions, Health Insurance Company Profits, and common sense Monthly Premiums & Co-pays, I truly feel we will be well on our way to a successful National Healthcare Reform that exists in every other developed Nation.  This process should not scare individuals with added worry about how exactly their ailments and limited income are going to affect their ability to access the health care they need.  I think you are doing a great job and I hope party affiliation doesn't ruin good ideas and progress.","2017-03-08T05:15:42+0000",0,0,"10158760156905725_233017600502738"

I'm proud to say, that tax payers do not have to pay for my healthcare, since I have not been prescribed medicine since 1993 (except for one antibiotic for a ""red throat"" which I had such a horrible reaction to, that I lost most of my vision for at least three months (lost my job because of it) - and if I had not handled that naturopathically, tax payers would have been paying for the outcome. Proud, to be vegan, proud to not ask tax payers to take responsibility for my actions.  Don't just take my word for it - ask the insurance companies for statistics.  Let's halt animal trafficking.  Statistically; those who harm or kill animals are seven times more prone to harming or killing of humans.

"563928927136710","Job in Political Education with Donald J. Trump","Dear Mr. President:
I know that this message is just one among thousands of others; but, if that is the best ratio or those the best odds I have of reaching you, then at least it is still better than not trying at all.  I maintain Hope of reaching you, soon.   
Mr. President, I am writing to you, again, because I want to be a part of “the Dream Team” and the movement to Make America Great Again.  I want to acquire a job in higher/political education, within your Administration, that we may fix the “Failing Grade” of educational curriculum and, specifically, eliminate standardized testing in education for America.  I want to acquire a position among ""the best and brightest"", and help Make American Education Great Again.

I am writing to you, again, because you told me to.  In your book “Crippled America” you wrote: “success requires persistence”, and I know myself to have indefatigable perseverance.

I am writing because I have sent Three hard copy letters to your home/office at Trump Tower, the first on September 9th, the second on November 2nd, and the third on January 17th.  I also, recently, resent each of these three letters again to your home/office at Trump Tower, as well as to The White House, on January 25th.  

All I want is for the American people to receive the best education they deserve. My aim is to liberate students and teachers from the tyranny of being seen as financially-driven ends, and finally eliminate standardized testing as the means of manipulating educational curriculum. This movement will affect all who are currently in school and any who will enter school hereafter.  Your son and grandchildren will be greatly affected by this movement and we can help change their education so that it will actually mean something to them, and help prepare them for everyday life: no more mindless, meaningless memorization without purpose.  It all begins with personalized education. 

Mr. President, the honor of this position is everything to me, and for America.  This job, this opportunity is one which is foundationally, transcendentally greater than any of us.  I am not just applying because it is what I want; I am writing to you, hoping to create this opportunity, because I genuinely believe it is what America needs: I am what America needs to fix the future of education.  I mean this without one shred of arrogance, but with the avid honesty of one who believes in a cause and a purpose fundamentally transcendental to self.  This is my life goal: to cure this country from the plague of standardized testing.  Working to change the future of education in America has been my dream-job, and the culmination of my entire life’s goals.  It would be an honor and a privilege to work for and serve You and America with a job in higher/political education.  

Please consider my materials and my unprecedented passion for all I am trying to do to fix the curriculum of education in this country. When you get a chance, please, at least skim through the slightly shortened version of my first letter, which I will post as a reply to this comment—a full copy of this letter as well as my other two letters (which are 11 and 10 pages long, and too long to post here) can be found at Trump Tower, The White House, and on my Facebook page, Job in Political Education with Donald J. Trump—and I believe that you will understand my outstanding passion, dedication, and ability for us to work together that we can improve our system of education for the future of America. 

I genuinely believe this is the right thing, and I am doing all I can to reach you, to help you to help our country, and to help you see me for me, and give me a chance to prove myself to you, and to America. 

I genuinely look forward to hearing from and working for you and my fellow countrymen towards a revolution in education!

Thank you, Mr. President.

Sincerely,

Ben Miller

(If you will, please forgive the cross-postings, but, in an effort to increase my likelihood of reaching someone who will reach you, I am posting this letter as often and as frequent as I believe fit, because this cause, this purpose, I believe, is transcendentally greater than single-posting modesty).","2017-03-08T04:51:19+0000",0,1,"10158760156905725_1904056603203772"
