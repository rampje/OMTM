# News Saturation

This directory contains the tools and research investigating a phenomenon that isn't new.

I've been calling this phenomenon **news saturation** and I believe it is happening at unprecedented levels.

**News saturation** refers to the disproportionate amount of news coverage a particular topic or story may get relative to all other news. A negative consequence of this is that the casual news viewer is potentially missing out on some important news that is not receiving similar levels of coverage due to the saturation from sensational stories.
