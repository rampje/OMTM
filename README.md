# OMTM

Operation Measure the Madness - previously called "Trump Analysis" until I decided this is going to take more manpower.

Personal research exploring the effect Trump has on media and internet and vice versa.

This repository contains tools for scraping and processing data from various sources.

## We want to:

1. Determine size and scope of "ecosystem" (people and media outlets)
2. Develop questions that can be tested with data
3. Build tools (crawlers, scheduled, scripts, web applications, whatever) to collect data
4. Analyze, understand and (if possible) predict stuff
